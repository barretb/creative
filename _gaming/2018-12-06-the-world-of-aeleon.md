I haven’t posted about my world building project in quite a while, but I have been working hard on fleshing it out. I’ve got several docs and spreadsheets put together. I also recently found a website called World Anvil that helps world builders organize and post their content online in a well organized, wiki-style format.

I’ve started transferring the information out to that site and will use it going forward. You can see that start of my creation, the [world of Aeleon](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aeleon-delban).
