I wrote this parody song a few months ago and only posted it to Twitter. Thought I’d add it here now as well. Sung to the tune of Drowning Pool’s “Let The Bodies Hit The Floor”.  All due apologies to [Drowning Pool](http://drowningpool.com/), [Paizo](https://paizo.com) and [Wizards of the Coast](https://dnd.wizards.com).

Original Song – Let the Bodies Hit the Floor by Drowning Pool

And now, my lyrics…..

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

Hit points drop off (drop off)\
Potion must quaff\
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

One, cleric come heal me\
Two, cleric come heal me\
Three, cleric come heal me\
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20\
Two, come on, roll 20\
Three, come on, roll 20\
Noooooooww!!!!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!

Bard sings again (again)\
Chased by gob-lin\
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

One, cleric come heal me\
Two, cleric come heal me\
Three, cleric come heal me\
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20\
Two, come on, roll 20\
Three, come on, roll 20\
Nooooow!!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaay!!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray

Zombies and wights, skeleton\
The wizard’s last spell, but then he’s all done\
Your rogue got you in and now you’re here\
You failed your save, so run in fear

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

One, cleric come heal me\
Two, cleric come heal me\
Three, cleric come heal me\
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20\
Two, come on, roll 20\
Three, come on, roll 20 Noooooooooow!!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray!

Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray\
Let the dice hit the tray

Heeeey!!!! Roll!!\
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!\
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!\
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!\
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!

And here’s a [link to my original tweet….](https://twitter.com/BarretBlake/status/1019692719336288257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\
I felt musical and gaming inspiration today. Apologies in advance to @DrowningPool, @Wizards_DnD, @paizo and pretty much everyone who sees this.

Let the dice hit the tray
Let the dice hit the tray
Let the dice hit the tray
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!
