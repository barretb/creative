The Sword Coast is an interesting area. Our adventures in the Wyrmfang Chronicles never ventured that far west. We mostly kept to the Dales, Cormyr, Evereska, and the areas between those lands. There were a few trips elsewhere, mostly to the far north or the far south. But never really to the west.

The only exception to that general statement is a couple of adventures that occurred in Undermountain, beneath Waterdeep. Those were usually one-off adventures, however, and not associated with the primary Wyrmfang Chronicles plot line.

D&D Games
On the other hand, I have been a huge fan of the Dungeons & Dragons PC games, many of which focus on the Sword Coast regions. So in that regard, I feel like I know quite a bit about it. Among my favorite games of all time are the two Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights games. I have recently begun replaying the Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition. And just before that I re-ran the Neverwinter Nights 2 primary campaign.

These games have provided me with endless hours of adventuring throughout the Sword Coast and surrounding areas. Wandering from area to area, killing monsters, taking bandit scalps, charging headlong into battle with Minsc and Boo! That is enjoyment you just can’t beat anywhere.

“Go for the eyes, Boo! Go for the eyes!”
