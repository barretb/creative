I posted these once before, but my site died and a lot of my old posts are gone forever. So I’m going to run this again. You may notice Day 29 is missing. Not sure what happened to it. Maybe I'll find it somewhere someday in an old backup

So this D&D 30 day challenge has been floating around for a while and I decided to join in. I’m expanding the definition to include Pathfinder as well as Dungeons and Dragons since that’s the rules system I primarily play in right now.

# Day 1 – How you got started

I was first introduced to D&D in elementary school. From time to time I would sit on the steps with some classmates during recess and we would play through modules, both official and homebrew. My interest waxed and waned over the rest of my elementary, junior and senior high school years. I had no interest in Greyhawk or most of the other campaign worlds, but if a session was going to be run in the Dragonlance world of Krynn, I was there.

I owned the Basic Rules set (1981 edition with the green dragon cover), the Advanced rules, and the Expert rules sets. I still have my Basic Edition pale blue, impossible to read dice set around somewhere, though most of the books and characters are long gone. It wasn’t really until 2nd edition was released, however, that I invested heavily in both time and books. 2nd edition, with it’s endless array of books and modules set in the Forgotten Realms was what drew me to regular gaming. I still had my love for Krynn, but as official TSR support had gone away with Dragonlance going to the SAGA ruleset, my interest in playing it also drifted away.

As I left high school for college and life, my time also drifted to other things and I played less and less. I found a few game sessions around campus at USU, but no groups really interested me longterm and few took it too seriously. I eventually got married, left school and moved back to my home state. As it so happens, about that time a couple of guys that I knew from school had a weekly group called The Wyrmfang Chronicles and were looking to add another player to replace someone who had departed the group. For more than 20 years now we have played nearly every week. Up until a couple of years ago, we adventured in a homebrew rendition of the Forgotten Realms, but are currently exploring a little bit of Pathfinder’s world of Golarion. We have transitioned from AD&D 2nd ed to 3rd, then 3.5. When the edition which will not be spoken of came out, we switched to Pathfinder and left D&D behind. And while 5th ed D&D has a few interesting pieces to it, there’s been no serious discussions about us switching.

I also game on occasion with other groups, but the only regular sessions I run are with the Wyrmfang group.

# Day 2 – Favorite PC Race

I’m a bit torn between human and dwarf. I tend to prefer humans for my arcane and roguish characters and dwarves for my divine and warrior type characters, but I don’t tend to favor one over the other. For instance, in the Shackled City campaign I played human bard. I was only moderately interested in him as a character, but was not disinterested enough to have him written out or killed off. It’s the only time I’d played a bard and wanted to see it through at least a ways. Through some events, he eventually had all his bard levels changed for a modified/custom cleric class. He ended up being one of my all time favorite characters, even though most of my clerics are dwarves.

Another of my favorite characters was a dwarven cleric who found himself travelling through White Plume Mountain in Greyhawk and ended up with an extra eye in the back of his neck, the ability to cast fireballs and believing himself to be Keraptis. That was a lot of fun.

On a couple of occasions I have played an elf, but I always play them as an outcast who cares little for the rest of elven civilization. That’s primarily because I find elves annoying in general. Well, at least pre-Lord of the Rings movies they were annoying.

# Day 3 – Favorite PC Class

Number one is wizard. My all time favorite character is a human wizard, a former Aes Saidar of Cormyr, currently evil thanks to his lust for power and reading a Tome of Evil. Wizards tend to use thought over brute force, which is my preferred mode of operation. That’s not the same as being passive, however. He prefers to act rather than endlessly discuss possible actions and had a habit of wandering off. It got him in trouble more than once.

Second favorite is probably warriors in general. Just because I enjoy opposites, I will often play a warrior character who will let others discuss and then bash when the time is right. Though, come to think of it, my warrior characters would often get bored and wander off as well. Maybe it’s just me?

# Day 4 – Favorite Game World

Hands down my number one all time favorite is 1st and 2nd edition Krynn. 2nd favorite is 2nd and 3/3.5e Forgotten Realms. I have to admit, though, that Pathfinder’s Golarion is starting to grow on me.

I haven’t delved too far into the 5th ed changes for the Forgotten Realms. After all the stupid crap they did in the earlier edition, I haven’t found myself all that interested in looking into it.

# Day 5 – Favorite Die or Dice

By far my favorites are my newest set of dice, the Q-Workshop Pathfinder Metal Dice set from their recent Kickstarter campaign. I got the silver dice and they are amazing. Well weighted and balanced, beautiful, smooth rolling and they make a great sound rolling into the dice tray. My only minor quibble is that they are sometimes hard to read. The numbers are small, so it can sometimes be difficult to tell if it rolled a 6, a 9 or a P (They replace the top number on each die with the Pathfinder P symbol. i.e. on a d20, P means 20, on a d8 it means 8, etc).

# Day 6 – Favorite Deity

Well, as with most things game related this has a complex answer. While we have played in a mostly Forgotten Realms world, it is a home-brew version where pretty much any deity was acceptable. As such, of the divine based characters I have played, 2 were clerics of Pelor, a Greyhawk deity, 1 was a paladin of Helm, a Forgotten Realms deity, 1 was a cleric of Heironeous, another deity of Greyhawk, and one was a cleric of Occipitus, not a deity at all really, but a plane of existence that kind of sits on the Abyssal range. However, it was formed from a fallen part of the Celestial planes, so it’s kind of lost in between. Now that we are playing in Golarion, my current cleric is of Ra, an ancient god of Osirion.

I enjoyed them all to an extent, but the one I had the most fun with was the cleric of Occipitus. He’s the same character that started out as a bard and was “converted”. If you’ve ever played the Shackled City campaign, you probably know about the plane of Occipitus and the Smoke-Eye. Aeduin took upon himself the guardianship of that plane and became its cleric, replacing one of his eyes with a smoking eye. It ended up being a lot of fun.

# Day 7 – Favorite Edition

There’s a lot to love about all of them (except the edition after 3.5e and before 5e that shall not be named nor acknowledged), but I prefer the Pathfinder rule set. They fixed much of what was wrong with 3.5e and added a few new twists that restore a lot of the joy of playing that had been diminished for a while. Yes, Pathfinder is a bit math heavy at times, especially when trying to figure out if bonuses stack, but I think it rarely causes the game to get bogged down and it adds a lot to the playability over 3/3.5e.

# Day 8 – Favorite PC Of Your Own

It’s a tossup between three of them. First, is Endeleban Losteast (Delban). He’s a wizard and former Aes Saidarr of Cormyr. He was the second character I played with the Wyrmfang Chronicles as we adventured through the dream realm of Ravenloft. It was there he made a mortal enemy of the death knight Soth and gained a Tome of Evil that he made use of later in a quest for power. After turning to evil, he entered the state of NPC-dom, making 3 or 4 appearances over the years before eventually returning to a PC status for a jaunt though the Underdark in the City of the Spider Queen trek. It was during this trek that he cast off the powers of evil that he gained for more neutral status and a future unknown.

Second is the paladin Terun Eastmore. As a paladin of Helm, he followed a path slightly adjacent to what most paladin’s might call correct. In 3/3.5e Forgotten Realms, paladins of Helm are concerned only with destroying evil where they find it, sometimes with a disregard for helping those in need or who might be deemed innocent. This led to some strife within the party and he eventually left to find his own path. He also lost an arm along the way, leading to endless jokes about the one-armed paladin in the party.

The last one is Aeduin, the cleric (former bard) of Occipitus. I mentioned him a bit in Day 6 and he’s the only character I’ve played through to level 20. He was last seen taking ownership of the Inn Between Worlds and giving it a permanent home on Occipitus. Little is known about what’s happening there but word is that Occipitus is quickly becoming known as neutral ground where all may gather without concern for too much trouble.

# Day 9 – Favorite PC you’d like to play

This is a question that is kind of vague. If it’s talking about pre-defined characters such as Drizzt or Bigby or Tanis Half-Elven or whatever, I don’t really consider them PCs. Even when I was involved in groups running the original Dragonlance modules, I didn’t really consider them PCs. They were NPCs that we’d temporarily stepped into playing.

I’ll interpret it, rather, as the favorite type of PC that I like to create and run. First, I like to have some sort of tie in to a previous PC or NPC. It’s never something big or something that really affects the gameplay aspect of the character. I just like to believe that all the great “heroes” have some thread that ties them all together. For example: my good then evil then neutral-ish mage Endeleban Losteast and my one-armed paladin of Helm, Terun Eastmore, are actually brothers. They are the middle two out of four sons of a Purple Dragon general. Delban was disowned for not following in the footsteps of his three brothers and joining the Dragons. He always preferred arcane studies to that of a warrior. Terun eventually found his way into the order of Helm through other events.

They are the two most closely related characters I’ve played. Others include two clerics of Pelor who both came from the same sanctuary. One took up the same quest as the other after the first one vanished without a trace. Another was a dwarven ranger who served an NPC king the group encountered in another module. And so on. Probably 80% of my characters have had at least some thread that tied them to a previous character or NPC from the Wyrmfang Chronicles.

Second, I like my characters to have a flaw of some sort. Whether it’s a paladin whose ideas on being a paladin aren’t quite the standard point of view, an elf who hates all other elves, or a character appointed as party treasurer who’s stealing funds from said party treasury, I like that there’s something that isn’t necessarily “heroic” about them. The last one was mildly amusing because we ran through pretty much the entire campaign arc without anyone figuring out that he was skimming about 10% off of the party treasure for himself. I don’t think they’ll ever ask me to be party treasurer again.

Third, I like for my character to be driven by some overreaching goal that happens to align with the party. He needs to have a reason to align himself with these people he normally wouldn’t. I’m not a fan of the “You look trustworthy!” approach (bonus points if you know the reference). Whether it’s a bard looking to restore his family fortune, a cleric seeking a cure for a mysterious plague or a mage lusting after power as a shortcut to greatness. My current character is a cleric of the old Osirion god Ra who is seeking to draw the old gods (read: true gods) back to Golarion by restoring worship of Ra to the Pathfinder world. He believes doing so is the only way to restore the true line of pharaohs (read: overthrow these ridiculous pretenders and restore the seat to the proper family) to the land.

Aside from those three points, I typically like to throw a lot of variety in there. Some people like every character to be the same: elven wizard, human barbarian, dwarven ranger, whatever. That’s fine for them but I don’t care for that. For me, playing the same character over and over gets old fast.

# Day 10 – Craziest in-game experience

There have been so many, it’s really hard to pick. Here are a few highlights, both as player and as DM:

- The endless jokes about being a one-armed paladin, including jokes that my mount should be a three-legged horse
- The time I was DM and a barmaid lured the fighter Jhon Tsaran to the barn for a “roll in the hay”. She was a medusa wearing a hat of disguise and the party had to haul his statue back to the keep. That led to a fun one-off session entitled “Bring me the head of Jhon Tsaran”
- The time our warrior got on the back of Lord Soth’s nightmare steed and it took to flight to the top of the castle
- The time Delban got stabbed with a spear and the following exchange took place: Farid: “I pull out the spear…No! Wait! I push it through!” DM: “You push it through?!? It’s an 8 foot long spear! It only went in 4 inches!”
- The time my thief was killed by a bodak and returned as a bodak player character for a while

# Day 11 – Favorite Adventure You Ran

As a DM, the one I’ve enjoyed the most was running Return to Undermountain and Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk back to back as one story arc. It was a blast and I had a lot of fun as the DM in that arc. My second favorite DM track was running the Speaker in Dreams module. I loved the illithid behind the plot, Gharaleth Axom.

As a player, my favorites so far have been Return to White Plume Mountain, Shackled City and facing off against Lord Soth in Ravenloft (I think the module was When Black Roses Bloom, but it was a long, long time ago). The last was a blast as my wizard Delban used a whisper/message spell to speak torturous words into the ears of the slumbering Lord Soth in trying to wake him from his trance and save his dying realm of Sithicus. It was also in Lord Soth’s castle where Delban ran afoul of a banshee, which had the effect of turning him all Raistlin-ish (white hair and gold, glittering eyes – no hourglass pupils thankfully) and probably started him down his path to evil. Blame it all on Ravenloft. It tends to have that effect on people.

# Day 12 – Favorite Dungeon Type/Location

My favorite dungeon types are old school dungeon crawls. Just a place underground with a bunch of levels and a bunch of halls and rooms on each level. First adventure I played was The Keep on the Borderlands. That style has always been my favorite. Castles, citadels, towers, cities, sewers, forests and whatever else take second place to the old school dungeon crawl.

# Day 13 – Favorite Trap/Puzzle

What’s the best way to put this? I HATE TRAPS AND PUZZLES! There, I said it and I won’t take it back. There is not one single, solitary trap or puzzle I’ve enjoyed or liked as a player. None, whatsoever. Whenever I encounter a trap or puzzle as a PC, I let the other PCs take care of it if possible and will only involve myself if I have to. Even when I play a rogue, I’ll let the others deal with puzzles and I’ll take traps.

As a DM, I understand that they are often necessary and will include them when I need to, but generally just the minimum effort (i.e. module as written for traps & puzzles, no additions or creativity usually).

# Day 14 – Favorite NPC

As a player, I think my favorite NPCs would be a tossup between Lord Soth from Ravenloft and all the various beings who believed they were Keraptis in White Plume Mountain.

As a DM, my two favorite NPCs were Gharaleth Axom from The Speaker in Dreams and Halaster the Mad from Expedition to Undermountain. Yeah, I know, Halaster dies at the beginning of the module. Well, not Halaster exactly, but his clone. The way I tied it into Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk it worked really well. They way I did it was that Halaster’s clone and Iggwylv’s clone fell in love and, tired of being slaves to their masters, plotted to trap Iuz, Iggwylv and Halaster in the God Trap to drain enough of their energy to become real beings. Their attempt to trap Halaster failed because at that moment the real Iuz and Iggwylv tried to open a portal from Greyhawk to Undermountain, causing Halaster to die and triggering the start of Expedition to Undermountain module with Halaster’s Call.

I think it turned out fantastically, but you’d have to ask the players. At the end of that when they had saved Undermountain, it flowed right into Ruins of Greyhawk where they from Undermountain in Faerun to that world and then dealt with the God Trap and ended the threat to both worlds.

# Day 15 – Favorite Undead

Bodaks. When one of my characters died by a bodak’s gaze and then turned into a PC bodak for a time, it was a lot of fun. Short lived, but fun. Unfortunately, as an undead, there was no way for the party to heal my wounds and eventually the damage accrued to the point of my destruction.

# Day 16 – Favorite Ooze/Aberrant Creature

Oh, another tough one. It’s a toss-up between beholders and illithid. They are both a lot of fun from a game stand point. And by fun I mean “AH! AH! AH! AH! RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN!”. Seriously though, one of the most fun adventures we have run was the Illithiad modules.

Although, the party did have a pet mimic for a while in Shackled City. He was fun. Guarded our house for us while we were out adventuring. Although, eventually we were gone too long and he got hungry and left. As I recall, the city guard had to put him down. Very sad….

# Day 17 – Favorite Animal/Insect/Arachnid

Driders…. Always driders. I love and hate those bastards. Yeah, I know, they’re not an animal or insect or technically an arachnid, but close enough for me. Though, when we ran through City of the Spider Queen we did run into a massive spider or two that made for some fun combats. Still, though… driders…

# Day 18 – Favorite Planar Being/Creature

This covers a wide band of creatures, so it’s hard to pick. I mean you’ve got celestials, formians, demons, devils, eladrin, djinni, mephits, nightmares, tieflings, slaads, and many, many more. How can anyone pick from among those? Let’s just pick one at random and say hell-hound. Here, doggy, doggy, doggy! Good dog! Uh, I mean, bad dog! OW! Stop biting me! Run!!!

# Day 19 – Favorite Elemental/Plant/Construct

Love the shield guardians. Delban had one for a while and it came in quite handy for saving his life multiple times. I also am fascinated by the more unusual golems. For instance, in 3e there was a stained glass golem that was pretty cool and Pathfinder has added a few like crystal golems and gelatenous golems that are also pretty cool.

# Day 20 – Favorite Humanoid/Giant/Fey

Fey annoy the crap out of me. Stupid tree-huggers. 🙂

Of these, my favorites are the fire giants. Tough, smart and not taking any crap from anyone. This goes back to the original 1st ed. G-series modules “Against the Giants” (G1, G2, G3). These were fantastic modules that ended in the “Hall of the Fire Giant King”. I loved that module. I thought it was a blast and have had an appreciate for the fire giants as foes ever since. I don’t think I’ve ever had an encounter with fire giants that ever left my party unscathed.

# Day 21 – Favorite Dragon/Dragon Type

As far as a specific dragon goes, the hands down winner is Tiamat/Takhisis. This is probably due to my great love for the Dragonlance books & modules as well as the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon that I watched as a kid. And yes I know she’s a deity and not strictly a dragon, but I don’t care.

As far as dragon types/colors, in general I’m a fan of the more exotic dragons, like the planar dragons. They’re an interesting group with a lot of unique and fun breath weapons to mess with a party of adventurers. As far as the “classic” types, I tended to like the brass and bronze dragons. Small, swift, independent and always speak their minds.

# Day 22 – Favorite Monster Overall

That’s a tough one, but I’d probably have to say the girallons. Nothing more terrifying than a 4 armed ape that can literally rip party members in half if they get a good grip. We had one encounter where just a couple of the things really beat the snot out of our party. It wasn’t fun.

Second favorite are beholders. Always a tough battle whenever you encounter one just because there are so many different types of attacks to try and defend yourself against, especially with the anti-magic cone from their main eye punking your abilities to do much damage to them.

# Day 23 – Least Favorite Monster Overall

Gnoll rangers. It’s a funny story. Well, OK, it wasn’t all that funny. You had to be there. Suffice it to say if the rest of your party is trapped behind an iron grate, don’t wander off to scout the area while they’re working to get through to your side. Just don’t do it. Don’t. Even if you’re a one-armed paladin. Just don’t.

# Day 24 – Favorite Spell

As a PC, my all time favorite is the cleric spell Flamestrike. That spell is frickin awesome. Half of it is fire damage and half of it is divine damage which bypasses just about any damage reduction.

As a DM, I’m overly fond of Silence and Greater Dispel Magic. Nothing like making PC spellcasters epically frustrated by not being able to cast most of their spells and for all the party members to lose their buffs and have their magic items effectively neutralized.

# Day 25 – Favorite Magic Item

That’s kind of a tough one. Again, I’ll split it up into player and DM faves and try and narrow it down to a couple.

As a player, one of my favorite magic items was a Tome of Evil that Delban picked up in Lord Soth’s castle in Ravenloft. It led him down a dark, dark path, quite literally. Eventually it caught up with him, however, as the forces of evil around Soth came looking for the book, forcing Delban to flee into the Underdark with a band of adventurers heading for the City of the Spider Queen. It gave him a reason to “rethink his life” and he is now on a path back to neutrality at least, if not eventually back to the light side.

Another player favorite was Whelm, a magical, drow hating war hammer. It would relentlessly sound a warning like a giant bell in the presence of drow. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the warnings more attention or we would have learned that one of our party members was actually a drow in disguise a bit sooner.

As a DM, I’ve had a couple as well. One was a magical axe of black metal that Delban fitted with a magical gem in which he temporarily captured the soul of his one-armed paladin brother, Terun. His intent was altruistic, even if his methods were not. It’s a long story with a happy ending involving a whack-a-mole stick, a rebel illithid and a city saved from invasion.

Another DM favorite is not quite a magic item, but a magical place. It’s a borrowed idea taken from an old issue of Dragon magazine. The Inn Between Worlds is an extra planar inn which wanders about, not tied directly to any specific plane of existence but with doorways leading to pretty much any of them. Some of them even lead to other times. The Inn traditionally has wandered through the multiverse, never really tied down anywhere. However, I have given it a more or less permanent home on Occipitus, the plane that’s not quite Abyss and not quite Celestial that is now linked irrevocably with my bard/cleric Aeduin. Aeduin has taken over ownership and has offered it up as neutral ground where all are welcome to come and trade, talk, make deals, or just drink. You may find a elves from Krynn meeting with elves from Myth Drannor, gnomes of Mt. Nevermind trading with warforged of Eberron, or a beholder and a gold dragon just getting together for a drink.

# Day 26 – Favorite Mundane Item

I don’t really give too much thought to mundane items. They are just the essentials that sit on your character sheet, barely noticed or acknowledged except on rare occasion. About the only common exception is rope. Every character I have ever created must have rope. Usually 100′ of silk rope if I can carry it without being encumbered. Rope is absolutely essential to survival in every single campaign I have ever ventured on.

Other items come in handy from time to time, but not regularly. Tinder twigs, chalk, marbles, caltrops, crowbar, alchemist’s fire, and so on. Aside from rations, though, only rope is absolutely critical.

# Day 27 – Favorite Curse or Cursed Item

I am perhaps overly fond of cursed items. As a DM, anyway. I find them amusing and when I DM, I have thrown quite a few of them at my adventurers. It’s never powerful cursed items, just little things that will cause mischief or annoy. My favorite, however, has to be the infamous Belt of Gender Change. Few things more hilarious than a party member that suddenly finds themselves of a different gender.

# Day 28 – PCs you have sworn off playing

None. I love every single character I’ve ever played and would play any of them again if a reason came up to do so. Some are more of a favorite than others, but I’d play any of them at all.

# Day 30 – Best Playing/DMing experience

Hmm, there have been so many that I have a hard time narrowing it down to one. Some of my favorites as a player include:

- When Aeduin threw himself into a pillar of fire to save someone (thus becoming the Smoke-Eye, changing from bard to Cleric of Occipitus)
- When Thelisn became a bodak PC and adventured for a time in that form
- When the Gogun, my dwarven cleric, learned how to cast a fireball spell in White Plume Mountain, pissing off the party wizard. Of course that led to him becoming one of those believing himself to be Keraptis…
- Playing Raistlin and facing off against Khisanth in Xak Tsaroth
- When my barbarian, Strom, one shot killed the enemy wizard with a critical hit during their first encounter, completely derailing the DM’s plan for the next 4 sessions.
- Finally, when Delban used a whisper spell to taunt Lord Soth in Ravenloft in trying to raise him from his stupor long enough to save Sithicus.

As a DM, I’ve had a few, but I’ve covered most of those in earlier posts and I’ve blathered enough across these 30 posts, don’t you think?
