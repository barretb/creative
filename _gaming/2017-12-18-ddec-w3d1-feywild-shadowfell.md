The Feywild and the Shadowfell are two parts of D&D that we really haven’t delved into much in our campaigns. We’ve had some dealings with faeries and nymphs and dryads, but never any kind of extended campaign dealing with them.

I wasn’t really sure what the interest in such things was. They always seemed more annoying than anything. Whenever they were introduced into an adventure, they seemed forced and didn’t really fit. That is, until I started reading the Dresden Files novels.

The way that Jim Butcher presented the realm of the fey finally brought interest to me. The way that they interacted with other creatures and realms in those books actually makes the fey interesting to me. It gives them a character and style I couldn’t get into before that.

The Shadowfell, or Plane of Shadow, is the more interesting of these two to me. The idea of a twisted reflection of the Prime filled with the undead and other creatures always seemed like a lot of fun. Add in a bit of Shar intrigue and there’s no end of fun there.
